      <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
      <p>
        My passion for computing technology has also been influenced by listening to talks from professionals in the field. During a visit to a University open day it was exciting to hear about projects and ideas that are currently in development, of which one day I hope to be a part of, ultimately making things easier for the modern world.
        I was the Course Representative for HNC Computing at the North Highland College UHI. In this role I attend meetings with the Course Tutors and fellow Course Representatives from the wider department. My objectives during the meetings are to relay feedback on the course, discuss areas of the course’s strengths and weaknesses, discuss college community issues and to ensure that previous actions are followed up. I volunteered for this role as I am ultimately aiming to work at a management level; I felt this opportunity would give me great experience in communicating in a professional capacity. I would ideally like to work amongst a team of programmers, all contributing to complete projects together. I believe learning techniques to be able to communication across different roles is vital to help everyone understand the main objective, a skill I feel is vital to implement in my professional career.
        I have been playing club football from the age of seven, committing my time to a total of ten teams over the years. During this time I frequently carried out the role of team captain, which is testament to my leadership and team working skills. I have been presented with many individual awards for my performance including The Wick Academy Youth Endeavour Award, which was an honour considering the talented people I have worked with over the years.
        I believe that a successful team takes advantage of the individual team member’s strengths and compensates for their weaknesses. I am very friendly and approachable and have contributed to the successful completion of previous group projects I have been party to. I have the confidence and motivation it takes to work on my own which is attributed to my inspiration, such as my family and friends who are very supportive of me and want me to succeed. Coming from a big family, I have been brought up to appreciate the hard work of others and how valuable it is to be independent.
        The good moral/ethical principles taught by the course I am studying reflect my ambitions for my career and future professional development. These values are in alignment with professional bodies such as the British Computer Society, and what they encourage.
