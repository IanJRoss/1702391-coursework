        "I have been playing club football from the age of seven, committing my time to a total of ten teams over the years. During this time I frequently carried out the role of team captain, which is testament to my leadership and team working skills. I have been presented with many individual awards for my performance including The Wick Academy Youth Endeavour Award, which was an honour considering the talented people I have worked with over the years. I believe that a successful team takes advantage of the individual team memberâ€™s strengths and compensates for their weaknesses."
